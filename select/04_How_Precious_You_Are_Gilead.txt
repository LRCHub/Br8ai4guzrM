Just something I want to say
Can't find another way
It's love, and it's here to stay
I want to tell you just how precious you are
Just how precious you are to me
You truly are so beautiful
You're more than life to me
I want to tell you just how special you are
Just how special you are to me
You truly are so wonderful
You're all that I can see
And I thank you for the way that you are
And how important you make me feel
This is love
This is love
No other way
This is love
Just something I want to say
A love so real
A love so real
This is love
Just something I want to say
This is love
Can't find another way
This is love
It's love and it's here to stay
A love so real
Yes, love so real
Yes, love so real
Love so real
